# PartyPlanner
PartyPlanner takes an input of a guest list and company list and sorts guests into a given number of tables with a given number of seats. No two guests from the same company will ever be at the same table, and excess guests who cannot be accomodated are left out. Programm allows user to add guests manually, find individual guests after sorting, and print sorted rosters.
